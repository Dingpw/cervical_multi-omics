### Required Softwares
#### WES
SoapNuke1.5.6, bwa 0.7.15, Picard 2.5.0, GATK 3.6

#### RNA-seq
SOAPnuke 1.5.6, HISAT, RSEM, Bowtie2

#### ATAC-seq
ATAC-seq data were analyzed according to the pipeline developed by Kundajeâ€™s Lab. Bowtie2, Picard, SAMtools, bedtools (2.16), phantompeakqualtools (v1.2), MACS2, and IDR were needed before analysis.

#### Hic-pro
HiC dataset were processed by standard HiC-Pro11 (v2.11.1) analysis pipeline.
